# Homework_02 Portfolio
So, I am not quite sure how to start this. But I suppose I'll just start right off with what I did. I probably spent too much time on the navigation bar. Lots of google and youtube tutorials to make that look and work somewhat nice. For the main body I just kinda looked around at other developers pages and tried to make it look similar to that. I would like to stand apart, but i dont know enough yet. So i just wanted it to look more presentable. My code is I think a little sloppy. in some places it works better than others. CSS, I know I could have done that better and think I will improve in the future. As for that goes I was just trying to make it work so I know its a bit sloppy in places. But I kept getting stuck. I am not terribly proud of the page. But i am turning it in because its due. I do plan to keep working on it and improving it. I did get some of the buttons to work not all of them. I ran out of time for the media screen. so thats not on there I assume I will be docked for that. But I did my best, so cant beat up too hard on myself. I plan on working on that as time goes on. I was trying it, but i couldnt get the picture of my avatar to squeeze with the screen. the screen would shrink and the picture wouldnt move? So I have a lot to learn yet. There was a couple other criteria I know I didnt meet yet. But, yeah this is my page.
